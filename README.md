## The Problem

Customers are waiting for help and the workers are not aware of this

## The Solution

Customers adding themselves to a support queue

## The Proof of Concept

- Customer walks into store. After some browsing, they decide they want some help
- Customer either finds an in-store call button or has an app to call someone over
- App uses the customer's location (or manually entered) to find where they are in the store
- Customer may also optionally enter a description of what they are wearing
- Worker receives a notification on their device that someone needs help
- App shows queue to worker and tells customer what place in the queue they are
- Once worker finds customer, they can remove customer from queue

## Note (Before Starting Project)

I don't have the hardware to make an actual button to press then sends a notification
to an app; this project is purely software. I also considered that if I did have a
actual button to press, it would also take a picture of the customer and write a short
description of what they were wearing so the worker could identify them easier. However,
there were to many outliers, I don't have the hardware, and it's pretty weird, so I
decided to not include the feature. I came into this project pretty ambitious, but after
thinking about what I can and can't do, this is starting to look more and more like a
simple TODO list; I am still going to do this project because I think it's a interesting
actual use case for a TODO list.

## Note (After Finishing Project)

TODO.
